# üìà Simple LSTM Stock Price Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict stock prices for Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA) using historical data.

## üîç Overview

- Downloaded historical stock data using `yfinance`.
- Visualized trends, daily returns, and correlations.
- Engineered basic technical indicators: SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands.
- Built and trained an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Evaluated predictions with RMSE and visualized actual vs predicted prices.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is a basic practice model, not for financial advice or real-world trading.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- yFinance
- TensorFlow / Keras
