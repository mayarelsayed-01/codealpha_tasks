# 📈 Simple LSTM Stock Price Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict stock prices for Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA) using historical data.

## 🔍 Overview

- Downloaded historical stock data using `yfinance`.
- Visualized trends, daily returns, and correlations.
- Engineered basic technical indicators: SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands.
- Built and trained an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Evaluated predictions with RMSE and visualized actual vs predicted prices.

> ⚠️ Note: This is a basic educational model, not for financial advice or real-world trading.
